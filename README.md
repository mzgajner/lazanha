There used to be a blog called kuham.si where Alain Å ik published his recipes.
Once a year, he posted a list of the funniest search terms people used to find
his website.

I randomly stumbled upon these blogposts and was incredibly amused by them. So
much so, in fact, that my friend circle still occasionally references some of
them in random conversations. The original site is sadly long gone, so this is
my personal backup. The blogposts are stored in the Web Archive though:
